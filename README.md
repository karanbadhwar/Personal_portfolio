It is a server side app, made with Express and Pug. 
As for able to exceed expectation, I was asked to change some styles in the CSS and add few animations.

Firstly, I changed the hover property on the Links, by addding Pseudo Element to the link and giving it a nice Border style.

Secondly, I added a Bottom-border to the rest of the links (BACK, LEARN MORE) links.

Thirdly, I gave a nice box-shadow to all the images in the portfolio and on hovering they scale out a bit extra to give a good animation
